Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious respiratory infection that primarily affects the lungs. It can be caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens. When a person has pneumonia, the air sacs in the lungs become filled with fluid or pus, which can make it difficult for them to breathe.

The symptoms of pneumonia can vary depending on the cause and the individual, but common signs and symptoms include:

Cough, often producing mucus (phlegm).
Fever, which may be high.
Chills and shivering.
Shortness of breath or rapid breathing.
Chest pain, particularly when breathing deeply or coughing.
Fatigue and weakness.
Muscle aches.
Confusion (especially in older adults).
Pneumonia can range from mild to severe and can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people, such as the elderly, young children, and individuals with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions. Severe cases of pneumonia may require hospitalization and intensive treatment, including antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia or antiviral medications for viral pneumonia.

Preventative measures such as vaccination, good hygiene practices (like handwashing), and avoiding close contact with people who are sick can help reduce the risk of developing pneumonia. Prompt medical attention is essential if someone exhibits symptoms of pneumonia to prevent complications and ensure proper treatment.
